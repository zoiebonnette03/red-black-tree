# Red Black Tree
Creation of a Red-Black Tree with proper rotation for Data Structures course final project. 

A red-black tree is self balancing binary tree with specific rules to keep the orgnaization:
1. The root is always black and leaves are always black.
2. No two consecutive red nodes
3. Every path has the same number of black nodes

In order to stay in line with these rules, there must be balancing operations (such as left and right rotations with appropriate color changes).
My program demonstrates this -- it is a little rough since I am new to data structures and algorithms. I have tested it as best I can, but if anyone has any suggestions
on how to improve, I would appreciate it!
